# RSA CHALLENGE
The RSA challenge was a series of cryptographic challenges that were proposed by RSA Security, a company that specializes in cryptography, in order to demonstrate the strength of the RSA encryption algorithm. The challenges involved the use of large prime numbers to generate public and private keys that could be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. The goal of the challenge was to factorize a large composite number that was the product of two large prime numbers.

The first RSA challenge was issued in 1991, and it involved factoring a 129-digit composite number. This challenge was successfully completed in 1994 by a team of researchers using a distributed computing approach.

Subsequent challenges involved larger and larger composite numbers, with the most recent challenge being issued in 2007 and involving a 307-digit composite number. The RSA challenge was important in demonstrating the strength of the RSA algorithm, as well as in advancing the field of cryptography by encouraging the development of new and more efficient factoring algorithms (chatGPT).
